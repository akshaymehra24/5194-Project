# RelationCNN model from Deep Learning for NLP - Tutorial

Heavily trimmed version of the Deep Learning for NLP tutorial series, only including code for the RelationCNN model
presented in the Nov. 2016 seminar (see description below)

## Deep Learning for NLP - Seminar - Nov. 2016
In November 2016 I gave a seminar at the University of Duisburg-Essen. The slides as well as the source code is available in the folder **[2016-11_Seminar](2016-11_Seminar/)**. In the seminar I use Python 2.7, Theano 0.8.2, and Keras 1.1.1 to model four different deep learning models for NLP:

1. Feed Forward Architecture for Sequence Classification (e.g. POS, NER, Chunking)
2. Convolutional Neural Network for Sentence / Text Classification (e.g. sentiment classification)
3. Convolutional Neural Network for Relation Extraction (e.g. semantic relation extration)
4. Long-Short-Term-Memory (LSTM)-Networks for Sequence Classificaiton

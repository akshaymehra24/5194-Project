The intestinal absorption of <e1>arsenate</e1>(<e2>As(V)</e2>) has been investigated in the chick by means of the in situ ligated duodenal loop technique. 	None(e1,e2)

Exposure of the muscle to <e1>ouabain</e1> (10(-5) M) markedly increased the <e2>PTX</e2>-induced release. 	effect(e1,e2)
The second response is due to a release of norepinephrine from nerves and was potentiated by <e1>ouabain</e1> through the increase in the norepinephrine release, whereas the first response was not due to the norepinephrine release but presumably to a direct action on smooth muscle cell and was inhibited by <e2>ouabain</e2>.

Potential differences in <e1>cyclosporine</e1> dosing and pharmacokinetics at different levels of <e2>everolimus</e2> exposure were assessed in the context of ANOVA. 	None(e1,e2)
<e1>Cyclosporine</e1> doses, trough concentrations, and AUC exhibited similar temporal patterns during the course of the study regardless of the co-administered <e2>everolimus</e2> dose level (P = .13, .82, and .76, respectively). 	None(e1,e2)
For a 4-fold range of <e1>everolimus</e1> doses there were no differential effects on <e2>cyclosporine</e2> dosing or pharmacokinetics.	None(e1,e2)
<e1>Rifampin</e1> and <e2>warfarin</e2>: a drug interaction.	int(e1,e2)
The drug interaction between <e1>warfarin</e1> and <e2>rifampin</e2> is not well known. 	int(e1,e2)
<e1>Rifampin</e1> has been reported to increase the <e2>warfarin</e2> requirements in human subjects ingesting these agents simultaneously. 	mechanism(e1,e2)
The concomitant administration of <e1>rifampin</e1> and <e2>warfarin</e2> resulted in the need for an unusually high maintenance dose of warfarin (20 mg per day) in order to produce a therapeutic effect. 	mechanism(e1,e2)

Withdrawal of <e1>rifampin</e1> decreased the <e2>warfarin</e2> requirement by 50%. 	mechanism(e1,e2)
This effect may be mediated by the ability of <e1>rifampin</e1> to induce microsomal enzymes and, thus, the catabolism of <e2>warfarin</e2>. 	mechanism(e1,e2)
The effect of <e1>rifampin</e1> on the <e2>warfarin</e2> requirement of our patient appeared to be maximal 5 to 7 days after the initiation of rifampin and extended a similar length of time after rifampin withdrawal. 	effect(e1,e2)
